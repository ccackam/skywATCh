An improved ACT plugin for X-Plane.

# **!! THIS PLUGIN IS STILL IN DEVELOPMENT !!**

## Introduction
This plugin will be freeware and will seek to fill the void of easy to use realistic ATC programs. Initially it will be instrument flight rules (IFR) focused, but I hope to support visual flight rules (VFR) in the future. It is likely that I will transition to developing this for the new Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 upon it's release. This depends on the access that amateur developers are given in this new simulator. Regardless. The desire is to develop this in such a way, that it is easy to transition between simulators, and even offer basic functionality (IFR Clearance, take off and landing clearance, ATIS, etc..) independent of a simulator. Much is yet to be decided and more specifics will follow as I move past the planning stage. Regardless, I'm excited to share this program with you! More to come.
